# System Instruction / PRD: LLM-Powered Job Hunting Application

## Objective
Build a one-stop solution to streamline data science or analytics job hunting. The application should centralize and automate steps such as:

- Researching target companies
- Discovering relevant job postings
- Customizing outreach messages
- Tailoring resumes
- Preparing for interviews

The end goal is to drastically reduce the manual overhead and provide a smoother, data-driven, and LLM-augmented experience for job seekers.

## Problems: Current Job-Hunting Workflow is Fragmented

### Role Discoverability
- Over-reliance on LinkedIn notifications to push relevant jobs based on the filters; potential missed roles
- Example: Missed an analytics lead posting at [future.co](http://future.co/) because LinkedIn did not surface it

### Outreach
- Manual drafting of messages via ChatGPT or self-writing, which can be repetitive and insufficiently personalized
- Difficulty identifying the most relevant person in a given company for networking or referrals

### Resume Optimization
- Maintaining multiple versions of a resume is cumbersome, and not knowing if the resume is tailored to the job requirements and the company
- Lack of a quick, automated way to highlight skill gaps based on a job description

### Interview Preparation
- Scattered search for interview tips, reviews, salary insights, etc.
- Uncertain how up-to-date or accurate the interview advice is, or whether it is customized to the specific role

A single platform that streamlines these tasks would greatly enhance productivity and effectiveness in job searching.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Role Discoverability
#### Company Intelligence
1. Provide a list of interesting companies based on user-defined criteria, e.g.:
    - "AI startups in the US that recently raised funding"
    - Include relevant metadata: funding round, key investors, location, employee size, etc.
2. Surface relevant open positions based on user-defined criteria
    - Desired title, skills, location, or domain (Data Scientist, Analytics Lead, etc.)

### 2. Outreach
#### Message Drafting
1. Craft personalized messages (LinkedIn InMails, emails) by combining:
    - User's background/experience
    - Specific job posting details
    - Information about the target company

#### Target Person Discovery
- Identify the most relevant contact(s) in a specific company for networking or referrals, e.g. team leads, hiring managers, or potential future colleagues

### 3. Resume Tailoring
1. Based on a job posting, automatically rewrite or suggest edits to the resume. Emphasize skills/experiences critical to the target role
2. **Skill Gap Analysis**:
    - Summarize missing or underrepresented skills in the candidate's current profile compared to the job requirements
    - Suggest resources or topics to learn

### 4. Interview Preparation
1. Provide interview tips, likely questions, relevant background about the company, and aggregated reviews (e.g., from Glassdoor or other sources)
2. Facilitate a quick summary of what the candidate needs to know for each interview round

## Development Principles & Architecture

### 1. Development Pacing
1. Please build the functionality step by steps, do not build all the functionality at once, developer will instruct you on which features to build first as minimal viable solution
2. Please always check the dependencies when building new features, to make sure the newly added code will not crash the previous functionality
3. Avoid rule-based replacement: Do not rely excessively on if-else logic; leverage the LLM's adaptability and reasoning capacity

### 2. UI
1. **Framework**: Use Streamlit for the front-end
2. **Deployment**: Should be runnable locally and hostable online (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud or similar)

### 3. LLM Model
- **Model-Agnostic**: While prioritizing OpenAI models, design the system so that other LLMs can be substituted easily

### 4. Data & APIs
1. Propose leveraging external APIs where needed for research
2. Example: Perplexity for web research queries, or other job listing APIs

### 5. Code Structure & Orchestration
#### Modular
Separate concerns for clarity and maintainability (e.g., dedicated modules for role discovery, outreach drafting, resume optimization, etc.)

#### Use Langchain
(if beneficial) with recommended components:
1. **RAG**: Ability to retrieve PDF files (e.g., resumes, company reports) or information from URLs
2. **Agent (ReAct paradigm)**: Let the LLM reason about sub-steps or external calls
3. **Prompt Template**: Standardize prompt structures for different tasks (resume rewriting, outreach, interview prep)
4. **Function Calling**: Where available, use function calls or structured queries to retrieve data
5. **Memory**:
    - **Important** to maintain continuity across job search sessions
    - Persist key user preferences, past interactions, or discovered leads locally
    - On each interaction, load historical context to ensure consistent and personalized suggestions
6. **Logging**: Integrate with tools like Langsmith for robust logging and analytics

## Example User Flow

### Home/Dashboard View
Upon launching the application, the user sees a dashboard with high-level options:

1. **Discover Jobs/Companies**: allows user to input their criteria to the agent and expect response on relevant job openings and the company information
2. **Optimize Resume**: allows user to upload or use pre-loaded resume and input the URL of the job posting, and expect to return with summarization of resume optimization tips, the refined resume
3. **Outreach**: allows user to input the purpose of outreach, the relevant companies and job postings, with expected response of crafted outreach message
4. **Interview Prep**: allows user to input the job postings, with return of relevant interview tips, company ratings (e.g. Glassdoor), and company information such as funding history and valuation, financial performance

Each option can be accessed independently. Users choose where to start based on current needs.

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Technology
1. **Frontend**: Streamlit
2. **LLM Integration**: OpenAI or alternative LLM (Anthropic, etc.)
3. **Langchain**: For advanced prompting, agent orchestration, retrieval, and memory
4. **External APIs**:
    - Perplexity for broad web queries
    - Possibly job board APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)
    - (Optional) Company data aggregator (Crunchbase) for funding or industry insights

### 2. Code Structure
```python
project_root/
├── main.py               # Streamlit entry point
├── modules/
│   ├── role_discovery.py
│   ├── outreach.py
│   ├── resume_optimizer.py
│   ├── interview_prep.py
│   └── memory_manager.py
├── prompts/

│   └── ...
├── utils/
│   ├── api_clients.py
│   ├── logging.py
│   └── ...
└── requirements.txt      # Python deps
```

### 3. Security & Privacy
- Store API keys in environment variables or a secure configuration file (not in plain code) that will not be committed to Git
- Handle user data and logs responsibly to avoid leaking sensitive information (e.g., personal details or entire resumes)
